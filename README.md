# simple-circular-timer
- A simple circular timer inspired by the app "Forest."
- Integrated into my website using JSS & .mdx: https://brianprussell.com/projects/circulartimer/

## What it is.
- A simple timer designed to test my programming logical thinking and problem solving skills.

## FEATURES
- START: starts the timer counting down from the selected time to zero.
- STOP: Stops the timer.
- RESET: Resets the position of the dot to 12 o'clock, and the timer to 00:00.
- When the timer reaches 0, it displays "Congratulations" in a hidden text field.


## IMPROVEMENTS
- I couldn't figure out how to color the dot without breaking other things, so figuring that out would be nice.
- The timer starts at 120:00 rather than 00:00, I wish I knew how to change this!
- A more aesthetic look and button feel would be nice, but tkinter/canvas only allows so much and python is limiting in this regard to me. I tried Custom Tkinter... but it was a lot. Ahaha!

### Notes:
- I was messing around with customtkinter so there's a .venv folder! Oops!
